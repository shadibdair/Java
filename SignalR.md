SignalR

SignalR is a way to allow us to create 'real time' application over HTTP as many you probably already know
HTTP is a standard protocol used to comminicate from the client to the server, it's used for website its why you go to HTTP .

Realtime what i mean by that is whem something happens on the server all the clients are going to know immediately,
This could be great for chat applications / video games / automatic update of news or stock market prices.
Anything like that, that needs to be update automatically this will be a graet candidate.
SignalR can also be used for phone apps and other things like that but generally it's used for asp.net web applications.
Asp.net is the way we create websites using the net framework hance the dotnet in C SHARP.

CLIENTS  send data to the server or make request can just go right through the SignalR TUNNEL & the server can do the same
At the same time so we have this bi-directional communication between the two.
